## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7, part 1
This was my favorite lab because we got to use if statements to create parking street signs. I found it interesting trying to figure out the days and times allowed to park. I also really enjoyed using booleans as a way to show that only certain times, days, and minutes were allowed.


* Lab 6, part 2
This was my second favorite lab because I got to code one of my favorite real life games onto my computer.I had so much fun again using booleans and if statements while also using vectors and strings. It was so fun putting together if your cards were a bust, if you got a face card and if you got a regular card.



* Lab 11, part 2 
This lab was the most recent lab I did but it was also extremely fun. Making a guessing game like the demos my professor has done in class using booleans and even introducing the void functions. This lab came to my partner and I very easily which allowed us to work together well and finish on time.
